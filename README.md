## Who Is This For?

**Anyone!**  
You don’t need to know anything about programming or web development. If you can type a name and click a button, you’re good to go.

This project was built to practice **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, but it's also a real app you can use.

## 🎨 The Look

The design was inspired by the **iOS 18** style — soft colors, smooth shadows, and a clean layout. Everything is built using:
- **HTML** – for structure  
- **CSS** – for beautiful styling  
- **JavaScript** – for the magic and interaction you came for

## ⚙️ Techie Stuff (Skip this if you're not curious)

This app uses **JavaScript DOM manipulation** to:
- Dynamically add and remove guest items

It’s all in one file, easy to understand, and ready to be customized.

## Why I Built This

This was part of a JavaScript DOM assignment. But I wanted to make it personal and fun. So I used custom styles, playful variable names, and made sure anyone can use it without needing a programming degree or complex knowledge on programming.
